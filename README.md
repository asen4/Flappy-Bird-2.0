# Flappy-Bird-2.0
(This version contains comparatively better graphics than that of the original.) In this game, the player can control the movement of the bird. Pressing the button makes the bird leap upward and on releasing the button the bird will fall freely. In the proposed game design, as soon as the game begins, obstacles will keep appearing from the right side of the screen and move leftwards which will make bird seem to be flying in the forward direction. The goal of this game would be to control the bird, dodging and passing it through as many obstacles as possible. This will run endlessly until the bird hits the obstacle, ground, or ceiling. Thanks for playing! Have fun!
